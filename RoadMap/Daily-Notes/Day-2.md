## Past Attacks

- **Two NoteAble attacks**
	 - **Love Letter Malware**: Emails ⇒ Attachments  ⇒ Scan ⇒ Addressbook Access for the Contacts ⇒ Send link to all ⇒  Install Program ⇒ Capture Credentials 
		 - Data breach of users is because of preference of  **Convenience over privacy** 
	 >[!Notes] **Phishing**
		>   - Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.
		>    - **Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
	 - **EquiFax** attack data breach via Phishing stealing customer records including PII and SPII.
	   -  575 Million Dollar in Damages 
 >[!Warning]  
   >Never Prefer Convenience over Privacy
   
   ## Attacks in Digital Age
-  **Certified Information Systems Security Professional** 
	  - **Eight Security Domains**
	
		![CISSP](/Images/banner-info.svg)

	1.**Security And Risk Management**
	  - Define Security Goals, Objectives, Risk Mitigation, Compliance, Business Community and the Law

	2.**Asset** **Security**
	- Secures **digital** and **physical assets** as well as related to tasks of the storage and maintenance, retention, and destruction of data

	3.**Security Architecture and Engineering**
	- Optimizing the data security by ensuring effective tools , systems and processes are in place.

	4.**Communication and Network Security**
	  - Manage and physical networks and wireless communications.
		  - Example:  Unsecured WiFi

	5.**Identity and Access Management**
	- Keeps data secure by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets like office spaces, and logical assets such as networks and applications.
	  >[!Example]
	  >Correct Level of Access like tasking with the project of keycard access to the floor.
	  >

	6.**Security** **Operations**
	  -  Focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
	  >[!Example]
	  > Unknown device connected to your internal network. Then one has to follow policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat.
	  
	7.**Software Development Security**
	- Focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
	  >[!Example]
	    > One of your partner teams is creating a new mobile app, then you may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user data is properly secured and managed

	8.**Security Assessment and Testing**
	- This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
	- Security analysts may conduct regular audits of user permissions, to make sure that users have the correct level of access.
	  >[!Example]
	  >Access to payroll information is often limited to certain employees, so analysts may be asked to regularly audit permissions to ensure that no unauthorized person can view employee salaries
	
## Benefits of Security 
 -  Protection against internal and external threats
 -  Regulatory Compliance to avoid fines especially during audits
 -  Maintains and improve business productivity
 -  Reduce expenses like data losses and downtime
 -  Brand Trust

## Assignment
-  `Phishing emails` often contain multiple 
	- **red flags**—unusual signs that make them seem suspicious. Some red flags are subtle (like a generic greeting)
	- **definitive technical indicators** that prove the email is malicious (like a bad domain name)


> [!tip] 
> - ✅ **Secure:** Look for **HTTPS**, correct **spelling of domain**, and **no weird extra words** before the main brand name.
>- 🚩 **Suspicious:**>
> 	  - Uses **HTTP** (not secure)
> 	   - Domain is **not** the official one — anything **before the first slash** is the real domain
> 	   - Has strange prefixes like `login-security.net/...socialmedia...`
> 	   - The domain name of the company always remains first rather than becoming sub-domain

## Types of skills
- **Transferable Skills**
	- Skills that can be applied across different careers
		- Like Communication, Collaborate , Analysis, Problem Solving
- **Technical Skills** 
	- Skills that include requiring of knowledge to specific tools, policies and procedures. Following are few technical skills of an analyst :
		- Understanding programming languages i.e Python and SQL
		- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Tools
		- Computer Forensics
		- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)

- **Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII)**
	- A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines
- **Personally identifiable information (PII)**
	- Any information used to infer an individual’s identity
